# Solar-System-Simulator
- As I go through my coding journy to understand and learn how all types of algorithms work, I had stubbled upon my most exciting challenge
- I've started learning physics in the University of Central Flordia and found all types of projections and simulations in physics to be interesting
- Here I will start to show my true pation in computer science and coding through my skills
- I Developed some interactive UI for the player
